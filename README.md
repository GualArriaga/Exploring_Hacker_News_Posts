# Exploring_Hacker_News_Posts

In this project, I am going to explore the data of Hacker News site. We will be focused on the posts and their quantity of comments to measure engagement. Our interest is in two main posts categories, **ASK HN** and **SHOW HN**.

Please, notice that I did the project without using numpy arrays or pandas. We know that it could have helped, but I intended to do it only using lists and dictionaries.
